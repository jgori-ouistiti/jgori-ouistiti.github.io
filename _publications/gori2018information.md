title: "Information-theoretic analysis of the speed-accuracy tradeoff with feedback"

excerpt: "In our 2018 TOCHI publication, we presented a full transmission model from which Fitts’ law could be derived. However, that model was not capable of encompassing feedback. Here, we propose to adapt a transmission scheme with feedback to the case of pointing."

In our 2018 TOCHI publication, we presented a full transmission model from which Fitts’ law could be derived. However, that model was not capable of encompassing feedback. Here, we propose to adapt a transmission scheme with feedback to the case of pointing.
