title: "The perils of confounding factors: How Fitts’ law experiments can lead to false conclusions"
collection: International Proceedings

excerpt: "In this paper, we study how and why the typical experiment design in Fitts’ law studies does not allow one to discriminate between the Fitts model and a simple distance covering model. We propose a simple check to make sure you are not exposed to that risk when conducting a Fitts’ law study."

In this paper, we study how and why the typical experiment design in Fitts’ law studies does not allow one to discriminate between the Fitts model and a simple distance covering model. We propose a simple check to make sure you are not exposed to that risk when conducting a Fitts’ law study.
