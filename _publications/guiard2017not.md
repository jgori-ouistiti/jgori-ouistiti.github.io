title: "Not Just Pointing: Shannon’s Information Theory as a General Tool for Performance Evaluation of Input Techniques"
collection: Others
permalink: publication/guiard2017not
excerpt: "Shannon’s Information Theory is usually regarded in HCI as an old theory that has only been useful in the context of Fitts’ law. Yet, information theory is a statistical description of symbols, and therefore can potentially map to many other scenarios in HCI. Here, we attempted to show some potential benefits of using Shannon’s information theory. This is still work in progress; in fact it has been on hold for some time now. If you feel like this is interesting and you would be willing to contribute/have some ideas about this, contact me."
