title: "How Relevant is Hick’s Law for HCI?"
collection: International Conference
permalink: /publication/liu2020relevant
excerpt: "Hick’s Law is used in HCI to justify some design choices, namely to decrease the number of items displayed at once. Here, we revisit this traditional design choice, and show that Hick’s law would advocate the opposite. We then argue that Hick’s law has little to offer to HCI. We then provide a design principle regarding the number of items to display at once based on the convexity of the response time function."

Hick’s Law is used in HCI to justify some design choices, namely to decrease the number of items displayed at once. Here, we revisit this traditional design choice, and show that Hick’s law would advocate the opposite. We then argue that Hick’s law has little to offer to HCI. We then provide a design principle regarding the number of items to display at once based on the convexity of the response time function.
