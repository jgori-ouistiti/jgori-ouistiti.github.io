title: "A Feedback Information-Theoretic Transmission Scheme (FITTS) for modeling trajectory variability in aimed movements"
collection: International Journal
permalink: /publication/gori2020feedback
excerpt: "Our information theoretic model with feedback presented at SMC 2018 is extended. We tackle the description of complete trajectories and incorporate a feedback mechanism. We find a characterization on the speed at which variability is reduced throughout the movement. This decrease explains Fitts’ law, and more generally, the speed-accuracy tradeoff."

Our information theoretic model with feedback presented at SMC 2018 is extended. We tackle the description of complete trajectories and incorporate a feedback mechanism. We find a characterization on the speed at which variability is reduced throughout the movement. This decrease explains Fitts’ law, and more generally, the speed-accuracy tradeoff.
