excerpt: "When we work on complex documents, we maintain an internal representation of the dependencies between various files needed to produce the final output, as well as their various histories. In this project, we make this internal representation explicit, and interactive. This provides the user with many additional features, including automation."

When we work on complex documents, we maintain an internal representation of the dependencies between various files needed to produce the final output, as well as their various histories. In this project, we make this internal representation explicit, and interactive. This provides the user with many additional features, including automation.
