excerpt: "Fitts' law is used in HCI to measure the *average*, *best* performances. Here we argue that it would be more clear to use two distinct metrics, one for the average performance, the other for the best performance. This is particularly useful when comparing data from a controlled study to more ecologically valid data."

Fitts' law is used in HCI to measure the *average*, *best* performances. Here we argue that it would be more clear to use two distinct metrics, one for the average performance, the other for the best performance. This is particularly useful when comparing data from a controlled study to more ecologically valid data.
