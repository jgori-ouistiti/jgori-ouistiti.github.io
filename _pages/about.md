I conduct my research in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), where I look to better understand how humans use, cooperate, and interact with artificial and computing devices. 
HCI is a multidisciplinary topic which brings together many fields of research; owing to my studies, my work is driven mostly by computational approaches.



I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at Aalto University and the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI), where I work on leveraging results from multi-agent systems to design intelligent assistants and tools which can account for each user's own capabilities and preferences. I am mainly targeting low-level mechanisms such as movement and vision for the moment, but plan to extend this approach to higher level tasks.


Before that, I have developped models to predict human produced movements. I have worked in particular on Fitts' law, a classical research topic in HCI, and an important predictor of movement time for many instances of interaction in HCI.
